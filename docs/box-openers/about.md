# About Box Openers

A box opener is EWN's equivalent of a miner and earn EWN rewards for their contribution in opening virtual boxes which
may or may not contain rewards. Box openers run Box Opener Nodes, a lightweight Docker container, which participates
in the EWN network to open the current box by generating password guesses. Once the password has been guessed any rewards
within the box are shared with the box openers who contributed to opening the box, the box opener who's node guessed the
correct password gets a bonus share of the reward.

To become a box opener you'll need...
* A verified Discord account that is greater than 30 days in age
* A Solana wallet address to receive rewards
* Some hardware to run the box opener node (literally any hardware that can run Docker)

Before you can start opening boxes you'll need to go through the onboarding process to generate an API Key which is how
your box opener node communicates with the EWN Oracle.
