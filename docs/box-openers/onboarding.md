# Onboarding
To onboard as a box opener visit the following URL to get started...
* Mainnet - https://erwin.lol/onboarding
* Devnet - https://devnet.erwin.lol/onboarding

Please note that if you wish to earn real rewards you must onboard to mainnet. Devnet is for development and testing purposes
only and rewards generating in devnet are worthless.

## Authorize with Discord
Once you click the onboarding link for the EWN network you wish to join you'll be presented with Discord Authorization, login
to your Discord account and click Authorize.

## Link Your Solana Wallet Address
Following Discord account authorization you need to link your Solana Wallet, copy your Solana Wallet Address into the form and
click onboard. Please ensure your Solana Wallet Address is correct before submitting as changing your reward recipient address
later will result in pending rewards being lost.
