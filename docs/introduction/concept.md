# Concept
Our contribution gods wanted to build a new Solana token to stretch our Oracle building skills and decided to base the token on the theme of "Meme Science". After some discussion it was decided that basing a token Oracle on Erwin Schrödinger's thought experiment regarding a cat in a box known as "Schrödinger's Cat" would be an interesting concept.

For those unaware of Schrödinger's Cat is a thought experiment which explores <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition" target="_blank">quantum superposition</a> in which a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive source, a flask of poison and a hammer actuated by a geiger counter. The box is solid and the observer is unable to see into the box. If the radioactive source emits a decay the geiger counter will detect this and smash the flask of poison releasing it and killing the cat. Due to the somewhat random nature of radioactive decay nobody is able to determine if the cat is dead or alive and hence the cat could be considered both alive and dead simultaneously.

EWN token seeks to replicate this thought experiment virtually. The token Oracle will recreate the experiment by having a virtual box, within the box is a virtual minter which mints tokens every minute, these are floating around in the box. There is also a virtual radioactive material which decays and a virtual geiger counter hooked up to a virtual match. For all purposes that entire process is really just a random number generator. The virtual tokens and minter are highly flammable and upon a random event may be burnt, and hence until the box is open the box is both simultaneously containing tokens and empty. A reward superposition! 

Of course impatient box openers would simply open the box after the first minute, claim the token which has been minted and await the next box. To avoid this gaming of the system we add a twist, the virtual box has a virtual electronic lock. Box openers must guess this password before it can be opened and take the rewards.
