# How It Works

The experiment is completed off chain by the Oracle and virtual tokens are used during the experiment "vEWN", this is to reduce transaction fees as minting and potentially burning tokens every minute would incur many transactions. At the end of the round once that box has been opened tokens will be minted and optionally burned on the Solana chain to record the box in the block chain. Tokens are initially created within a treasury account and the reward received by each Block Opener are recorded by the Oracle. Box Openers claim rewards via the dApp and these are transferred to their wallet, this reduces transaction fees compared to transferring small amount of rewards every round.
