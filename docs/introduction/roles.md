# Roles 

There are several roles which you may wish to partake in as a member of the EWN community.

## Box Opener
The Box Opener role is the equivalent of a miner in other crypto projects. Box Openers (people) deploy Box Opener Nodes (machines) which work together as a team to guess the password to open the box. Box Opener Nodes then share the rewards contained in the box (if any) based on their contribution, the Box Opener Node which successfully guessed the box password also receives a bonus.

## Liquidity Legend 
Mining not for you? You can still get involved with the memes by funding liquidity pools enabling holders of EWN token to trade against other assets whilst earning some sweet sweet fees. Remember providing liquidity is risky business and isn't for everyone, so make sure you research first! 

## Speculating Simon 
Love speculating on crypto assets? Why not buy and trade EWN token and ride the waves of the crypto market. Remember, crypto trading is risky business and isn't for everyone, make sure you research first!

## Contribution God 
Mind full of tokenomics and block chain development experience? Join the other crypto bros (non gender specific) on our core contribution team and help build out EWN and our other crypto projects. If you feel like you have relevant experience and can help out speak to the contributors on Discord to see if we need your skills.
