# Roles

There are several roles which you may wish to partake in as a member of the EWN community.

## Box Opener

The Box Opener role is the equivalent of a miner in other crypto projects. Box Openers (people) deploy Box Opener Nodes (machines) which work together as a team to guess the password to open the box. Box Opener Nodes then share the rewards contained in the box (if any) based on their contribution, the Box Opener Node which successfully guessed the box password also receives a bonus.

The Box Opener role is given to community members who actively contribute in a positive way and help promote EWN. To apply for this role, you must first engage with the community, then submit a Box Opener Application through the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GechF7dFHZ). The flowchart below outlines the steps to determine if youâ€™re eligible for the Box Opener role.

## Liquidity Legend

Mining not for you? You can still get involved with the memes by funding liquidity pools enabling holders of EWN token to trade against other assets whilst earning some sweet sweet fees. Remember providing liquidity is risky business and isn't for everyone, so make sure you research first!

## Speculating Simon

Love speculating on crypto assets? Why not buy and trade EWN token and ride the waves of the crypto market. Remember, crypto trading is risky business and isn't for everyone, make sure you research first!
